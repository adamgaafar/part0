In the course of developing this app, I reviewed:
- **HTML** and **CSS** for page structure and styling
- **Web Forms** for capturing and submitting user input effectively

### Diagrams Created

To better understand the app's data flow and interactions, I created the following diagrams:
1. **Single-Page App Initialization**: Shows the process when the user navigates to the SPA version of the notes app.
2. **Creating a New Note**: Details the interactions when a user adds a new note on the traditional version of the app.
3. **Adding a Note in the SPA Version**: Illustrates the process for creating a new note in the SPA without a full page reload.

These diagrams highlight the client-server interactions, AJAX requests, and dynamic DOM updates handled by JavaScript.
